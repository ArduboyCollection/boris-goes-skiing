# boris-goes-skiing

Very early stages of "Boris goes skiing" for the Arduboy, a clone of the ZX Spectrum game "Horace goes skiing" 

Controls:
Title screen will show for 5 seconds, then the game will start, use left and right buttons to control Boris to ski through the flags and avoid the trees.

Tree hit = loose a life.
Flag pass = get a point.
